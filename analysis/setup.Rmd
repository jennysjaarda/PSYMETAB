```{r knitr-opts, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "#",collapse = TRUE)
```

**Last updated:** `r Sys.Date()`

**Code version:** `r system("git log -1 --format='%H'", intern = TRUE)`

To reproduce these results, please follow these instructions.

## Setup instructions

All processing scripts were run from the root sgg directory.

Project was initialized using `workflowr` rpackage, see [here](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/articles/wflow-01-getting-started.html).

### On sgg server:

```{r eval=FALSE}
project_name <- "PSYMETAB"
library("workflowr")

wflow_start(project_name) # creates directory called project_name

options("workflowr.view" = FALSE) # if using cluster
wflow_build() # create directories
options(workflowr.sysgit = "")

wflow_publish(c("analysis/index.Rmd", "analysis/about.Rmd", "analysis/license.Rmd"),
              "Publish the initial files for myproject")

wflow_use_github("jennysjaarda")
# select option 2. Create the remote repository yourself by going to https://github.com/new and entering the Repository name that matches the name of the directory of your workflowr project.

wflow_git_push()
```

You have now successfully created a github repository for your project that is accessible on github and the servers. Next setup a local copy.

### On personal computer:

Within your terminal clone the git repository.

 ```bash
cd ~/Dropbox/UNIL/projects/
git clone https://github.com/jennysjaarda/PSYMETAB.git PSYMETAB
 ```

Open project in atom (or preferred text editor) and modify the following files:

- Because Terminal cannot generate a preview and `workflowr` doesn't like the sysgit, to the `.Rprofile` file, add:
  - `options(workflowr.sysgit = "")`
  - `options("workflowr.view" = FALSE)`
- To ensure git hub isn't manaaging large files, modify the `.gitignore` file, by adding the following lines:
  - `data/*`
  - `!analysis/*.Rmd`
  - `!data/*.md`
- Save and push these changes to github.
- Pull to the server.

### Return to sgg server and create internal project folders:

```bash
project_dir=/data/sgg2/jenny/projects/PSYMETAB
mkdir $project_dir/data/raw
mkdir $project_dir/data/processed
mkdir $project_dir/data/raw/reference_files
mkdir $project_dir/data/raw/phenotype_data
mkdir $project_dir/data/raw/extraction
mkdir $project_dir/data/processed/phenotype_data
mkdir $project_dir/data/processed/extraction
mkdir $project_dir/docs/assets
```

This will create the following directory structure in `PSYMETAB/`:

```

Raw PLINK (ped/map files) data was copied from the CHUV `L/` folder after being built in genomestudio.

## modify the .gitignore
Most steps are saved in shell scripts. This code should be able to run in any
Unix-like environment (of course after installing the necessary software). To
process the data efficiently on our HPC, we wrote a wrapper script,
[submit-array.sh][], to combine the many parallel jobs into one array job
submitted to the Sun Grid Engine (SGE) scheduler. Not only does this make it
easier for the scheduler (and you) to manage thousands of tasks, we also made it
so that it won't re-run jobs if the output file already exists. This is
convenient when a small fraction of jobs fail and need to be re-run. However, if
your HPC uses a scheduler other than SGE, you will have to decide how best to
submit the jobs.
