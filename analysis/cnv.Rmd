## Creating full data table for use in penncnv
- Instructions to create data for penncnv input were followed [here](http://penncnv.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/input/)
- `GS_project_26092019_cluster.bsc`, located here: `L:\PCN\UBPC\ANALYSES_RECHERCHE\Jenny\PSYMETAB_GWAS\GS_project_26092019_cluster`, was used to create the full data table.
- Output file was named the default name of `Full Data Table.txt` and saved in the same location.
- The output was then moved to the server to and run on with penncnv.
